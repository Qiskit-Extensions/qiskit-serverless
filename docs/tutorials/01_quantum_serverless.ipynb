    "**Background and motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Today a lot of experiments are happening on a local machines or on manually allocated remote resources. This approach is not scalable and we need to give users a tool to run quantum-classical workloads without worrying about allocating and managing underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the quantum advantage we need to figure out mechanism to combine Classical + Quantum computation, and how orchestrate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set of tools that allow user to execute hybrid workloads (combine/orchestrate Classical and Quantum computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiently manage abstractions for Quantum and Classical workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizes flexibility for users inÂ multi-cloud and HPC scenarios."

    "**Compute resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute resources can be described as set of computational nodes with resources associated to each of them.\n",
    "Nodes are performing computation itself. \n",
    "Distributed storage is for accessing sharable resources between nodes.\n",

    "![compute resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit-Extensions/quantum-serverless/main/docs/tutorials/images/diagrams_compute_resource.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to resolve distributed compute we need a way to orchestrate our workloads on remote resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look how to turn a local object into a remote one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn your local object to distributed one you need to call `put` function. \n",
    "It will serialize your object and send it to distributed storage and return you a reference to remote object location. \n",
    "\n",
    "![objects diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit-Extensions/quantum-serverless/main/docs/tutorials/images/diagrams_put.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cirucit = QuantumCircuit(N, M)\n",
    "...\n",
    "circuit_reference = quantum_serverless.put(circuit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to move local object to remote compute resource. \n",
    "Next we need to do something with it. For this we will have remote functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second step we need to know how to transform our local function into remote one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that you need to annotate function with `run_qiskit_remote` decorator. \n",
    "This will turn your function into remote executable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![functions diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit-Extensions/quantum-serverless/main/docs/tutorials/images/diagrams_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do now is call this function and it will be executed as a remote procedure automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you run N instances of this function in parallel you need just call it N times in a loop. \n",
    "The result of the following code will be a list of references to execution results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@quantum_serverless.run_qiskit_remote()\n",
    "def exp_val_remote(cirucit, obs):\n",
    "    estimator = Estimator(...)\n",
    "    return estimator.run(circuit, obs)\n",
    "\n",
    "obs: Operator = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "exp_val_execution_reference = exp_val_remote(circuit, obs)\n",
    "\n",
    "circuit_list: List[QuantumCircuit] = [...]\n",
    "\n",
    "obs_ref = quantum_serverless.put(obs)\n",

    "    exp_val_remote(circ, obs_ref) \n",
    "    for circ in circuit_list\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see we are passing an observable by refernce and circuits by values. Attributes passed by value will be converted to remote objects automatically and resolved within the remote function. We are passing observable by referece because we know it is the same one shared by all parallel function invocations, so we are saving some space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Collecting results**\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course you need to collect your results back from remote resources. \n",
    "In order to do that you need to call the `get` function, which can be applied to object and function references or, alternatively, to a list of references.\n",
