# Terraform configuration

This folder will provide you a set of configurations to deploy your k8s cluster and minimum requirements to be able to run the project.

Right now the project supports two platforms where you can deploy the infrastructure:
- [IBM Cloud](./ibm)
- [AWS](./aws)

In each folder you will find all the documentation to be able to run the configuration in each platform.
